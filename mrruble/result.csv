7 things to know when renting a skip,22nd Apr 2021,https://www.mrrubble.co.uk/7-things-to-know-when-renting-a-skip/,"7 things to know when renting a skip
Whether you are hiring a skip for the first time or have hired a skip before, our checklist will help you with considerations for choosing the right skip and making sure you’re prepared.
Here are 7 things to know when renting a skip.
What you can’t put in a skip
One of the most important considerations is what type of waste you will be putting in a skip and whether this meets the skip hire company’s criteria. Our blog summarises the items that can’t be put into one of our rental skips.
How long you’ll have the skip for
As standard, our skip hire is for 7 days so it’s important to consider whether this will be long enough. We are able to offer extended hire at an additional charge, just let us know. You can also get in touch if you’d like us to collect your skip sooner.
Understand how much waste each skip will hold
We offer a range of skip sizes, from 3 tonne skips up to 16 yard skips. Whether you are carrying out a small house clearance or taking on a big gardening project, there is a skip size to suit different needs.
We have information on how much each of our skips holds, including dimensions, how many rubbish bags it will hold and the types of project that they are suitable for. View our skip sizes > Decide which size skip you’ll need
After you’ve read how much each of our skips holds, you can then decide which skip size is most suited to the job. If you’re still unsure and require further advice, get in touch with us.
Consider where the skip will go
Our smaller skips will comfortably fit on most driveways. If you’re thinking of putting the skip anywhere else or are hiring a larger skip, you’ll need to measure the dimensions.
It should also be easy to access, both for disposing of your waste and for our trucks for pick up and drop off.
Skips should not obstruct pedestrians or the street.
See if you require a permit
A permit from your local council is required if you are wanting to put the skip on the road. If you request a roadside dropoff, we will arrange a permit.
Otherwise, a skip is permitted outside your home providing it isn’t an obstruction and doesn’t violate any traffic rules.
Leave instructions of where to leave the skip
We don’t require you to wait in for your skip to arrive, so long as you have pre-paid for the skip and leave us clear instructions as to where to leave it.
Any further questions?
Read our skip hire FAQs for further information, get in touch with us or rent a skip via our easy online form.

Refresh yourself and your home with a spring-clean,7th Apr 2021,https://www.mrrubble.co.uk/refresh-yourself-and-your-home-with-a-spring-clean/,"Refresh yourself and your home with a spring-clean
After a year of lockdown, we’re beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel, especially as so many have now been vaccinated in the UK.
As the days get longer and the weather gets warmer, it’s time to start thinking about opening up our homes to loved ones and friends.
After the year that was 2020, many of us will be eager to remove all traces of the past twelve months and is there any better way to refresh ourselves, and our homes, than with a spring-clean?
There are plenty of expert tips to save time and organise yourself so that it doesn’t become a tiresome chore. For example, you can make a list of jobs, move from room to room, and ensure it doesn’t drag on by setting aside as little as ten minutes a day.
When you’re wanting to dispose of any old or unwanted items, hiring a skip will help make the process easier, as well as making space for the new quicker.
Clearing out our homes and workplaces not only creates more room – it’s a valuable ritual which enables us to look forward and move on.  And, hiring a skip gives you the ability to throw things away easily and effectively.
You don’t have to worry about waste separation because everything – except hazardous waste – can be put into the skip, and we’ll do the rest.
We have a variety of skip sizes to suit your needs and once you’ve filled it, we’ll collect and dispose of it safely.
It also helps the environment because we ensure that everything which can be recycled is recycled.
Tidying up and clearing out don’t just have positive psychological benefits either, having everything neatly organised can save you time and money – even at the simple level of being able to find what you’re looking for without 30 minutes of trying and failing!
If you’re about to embark on your spring clean and want to hire a skip, then please
contact us here.

When you’re hiring a skip, it’s important to be clear on what can and can’t be put in a skip. There are certain items which aren’t permitted with regular skip hire and require an additional charge. Read on to find out what you cannot put in a hired skip.
Items not permitted in skips
Hazardous waste
Waste is generally classified as hazardous if it could cause potential harm to the environment. This would include chemicals such as pesticides, acids, fluids, oils, fridges and asbestos.
Similarly, any containers used to house hazardous waste cannot be put in skips.
Electrical items & appliances
Electrical items such as refrigerators contain chemicals that can harm the environment. All electrical items and household appliances should be taken to a recycling centre and not put in household bins or hired skips. In some cases, appliance manufacturers may collect items to recycle.
Batteries
As batteries and battery packs contain acid, they are not permitted in skips.
Gas tanks/cylinders
Some recycling facilities accept gas bottles. You can check your local authority at Recycle Now .
Fluorescent light bulbs
Whereas the older type of light bulbs are not recyclable and can be thrown away in your dustbin, the newer energy saving fluorescent bulbs can be recycled at local recycling centres.
Tyres
Check with your local council to see if recycling centres accept tyres. There are also some tyre manufacturers and dedicated businesses that will recycle old tyres.
Paints
Paints must be disposed of in the correct manner since the chemicals can be harmful to the environment. You can either leave it to dry on paper or cardboard and dispose of it in your household waste, or consider donating unused paint to someone.
Glues/solvents
Similar to paints, glues and solvents may be disposed of in your household waste if it is dried on paper or cardboard. Alternatively, there are specialist adhesive waste disposal services, or you can contact us 
for advice.
Medical or human waste
Medical or human waste cannot be accepted within your household waste or in hired skips. You can request a clinical waste collection via the Government website: https://www.gov.uk/request-clinical-waste-collection What should I do if I have items that cannot be put in one of your skips?
Call us on
0114 236 6222
if you plan on disposing of any of the items listed above and we’ll be able to advise you.
Where can I find further information?
You can learn more about disposing of hazardous waste on the Government website . Book a skip using our form or contact us if you have any questions about skips.

Your skip waste and recycling: where does it go?,26th Feb 2021,https://www.mrrubble.co.uk/your-skip-waste-and-recycling-where-does-it-go/,"Your skip waste and recycling: where does it go?
For years, it’s been an issue – sending colossal amounts of waste to overflowing landfill sites. Over the last few years, we have become more conscious of the environmental impact and our need to protect the planet.
Considering the UK creates around 290 million tons of waste every year, where does this all go once it’s collected from skips? Read our blog to find out.
Why is recycling so important?
Recycling is something we should all be concerned about for a number of reasons.
Lessening the environmental impact means that we are preserving the planet for future generations
Reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfill means that we’re less likely to be polluting the ground, as chemicals and contaminants can find their way into soil and eventually our water supply or food chain
It helps to conserve energy, reduces the hours and resources needed to dispose of the waste
It means we’re only producing what we need: if we continue to recycle materials such as aluminium and plastic, these can be used time and time again instead of producing excess amounts, thus also saving billions of pounds for businesses
Hiring a skip
A skip might be hired for a house clearance, building and construction projects or garden waste. But once you’ve filled the skip and it’s collected, where does the waste go?
Skip waste and recycling
When your skip contents are collected, you might assume they are sent straight to landfill. But actually, a large proportion of it is recycled.
At Mr Rubble, around 93% of the waste we collect is recycled at our state-of-the-art recycling centre, built in 2006.
We recycle plastic containers and bottles, glass bottles and aluminium cans, among other materials. In fact, the majority of the waste we collect can be recycled and doesn’t have to go to landfill.
Our team is committed to  protecting the planet and recycles waste in a safe and efficient manner.
How you can choose a responsible skip hire company
Check they have waste management and waste carriers’ licences
Ask for their policy on recycling and what happens with it when they collect the skip waste
Check what can and can’t be put in one of their skips so that you are not putting in hazardous materials
Read customer reviews to see what their service is like

Christmas Recycling Tips,17th Dec 2020,https://www.mrrubble.co.uk/christmas-recycling-tips/,"Christmas Recycling Tips
We are all more conscious of our impact on the environment nowadays. So how can you adapt Christmas so that you are less wasteful? Read our Christmas recycling tips to find out how you can enjoy the festive period whilst recycling what you can.
Know what you can recycle
If you’re unsure about what you can and can’t recycle, there’s plenty of information to guide you. Your local authority’s website will have information about recycling bins and what can and can’t be put in there. For example, used paper cups and plates can’t be recycled.
Wash out glass and plastic bottles
It doesn’t take long to wash out used glass and plastic bottles ready for recycling and it’s a massive help. At Christmas time, we will go through many more bottles, so once they are empty, wash them out and put them in the recycling bin.
Recycle cards
If you don’t want to keep your Christmas cards after the event, recycle them. You could even get creative and make your own gift tags from old Christmas cards!
Avoid plastics where possible
We’re all more conscious of the effect of plastics on the environment. Where you do need to use plastic, such as bottles, ensure these are recycled. However, consider using alternatives where possible, such as substituting the plastic cutlery for real knives and forks.
Avoid glossy wrapping paper
It may look nice and festive, but much of the laminated glossy wrapping paper and ribbons can’t be recycled and shouldn’t be put in the paper recycling. Consider if the wrapping paper can be recycled before you buy, use gift bags that can be reused and use tote bags or festive shopping bags that can be used time and time again.
Recycle your Christmas tree
If real Christmas trees are your thing, try to replant it for next year. Local authorities may also offer tree collection services, so check with your local council. Alternatively, Mr Rubble accepts garden waste as part of our
skip hire Sheffield
.
Rent a skip for big clearances
While clearing and recycling from Christmas, why not have a clearout at home ready for the New Year?
You can rent a skip from just £87.50, with a special offer and extended hire period. Now is the perfect time for clearance. And with Mr Rubble, the environment is one of our top priorities – we recycle 98% of the waste we collect.

Top tips to reduce waste,2nd Apr 2020,https://www.mrrubble.co.uk/top-tips-to-reduce-waste/,"Top tips to reduce waste
Reducing waste and recycling more is something we strongly believe in here at Mr Rubble, with ongoing environmental problems and local authorities experiencing rising pressure to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill we can all do our part to decrease waste. As part of the Sheffield and Rotherham communities, we make sure we recycle as much as we can from our skip hire skips and we have a dedicated recycling centre for our skip waste too. The top tips below can help us all do our part for the planet.
Recycle
By simply sorting your rubbish by recyclables and non-recyclables you’ll be helping to ensure that the recyclable items can be taken and turned into new items rather than ending up in landfill. Separating your rubbish is quick and easy with minimal time and effort being taken. Simply sort your rubbish as you go and you’ll be helping to make a positive difference.
Try to avoid buying products with excessive or unnecessary packaging
Plastic waste is a big issue and there has been plenty of articles and social media posts about this matter. To help reduce your plastic usage, try to buy less items that are wrapped unnecessarily in plastic and look for items in biodegradable or reusable packaging instead.
Start composting garden and food waste
One of the easiest ways to reduce the amount of waste going in the bin is to start using a compost bin for natural waste. This will allow all of your food waste such as vegetable peelings to be turned into compost which will not only reduce the amount of waste going to landfill but can also be used to help fertilise your garden.
Dispose of larger items at recycling centres or by hiring a skip
If you have some larger items that you would like to recycle skip hire is an excellent option, especially if the items are too large to fit into your car to take to the local recycling centre. When you hire a skip, you can easily clear out large amounts of waste in a short period of time. Try to go with a professional and ethical company that will correctly dispose of the skips contents. Mr Rubble are dedicated to recycling, if you are in need of skips Rotherham or skips Sheffield, we can provide skip hire and we recycle 93% of all waste we receive.
Repurpose and reuse where possible
Before throwing items away consider if they have another use or can simply be used again. Maybe the local school will benefit from the egg boxes or maybe you can reuse the plastic bag next time you go to the shops. Be mindful about waste and help make a difference from your own home.
These are easy steps that can be taken from the comfort of your home, by following these top tips you can reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfill and help the environment. If you are in need of

Skip hire offers a convenient and simple solution to waste disposal, below we’ll take a look at ways you can maximize the amount of waste you can fit in your skip.

If you’re planning to hire a skip in the Sheffield or Rotherham areas, take a look at our great prices and enjoy our friendly service.
Break Larger Pieces Down
Larger objects can take up more than their fair share of space but by simply breaking them up into smaller pieces where possible you can make sure there’s enough space for all the items. People often throw the large items into the skip first and then are left struggling when they’ve run out of space. Use this hack to avoid this.
Pack the Lighter Objects First
If you pack the lighter and smaller objects first and then the heavier items on top you’ll find you have more space. This method of packing allows the smaller items to become more compact thanks to the weight and pressure of the items above as you pile them into the skip. This means there will be more space on the top of the skip for the larger items.
Start with the Right Size Skip
When you decide to book skip hire, it is important to consider the different sizes of skip available. If you are unsure and looking for
skip hire in Sheffield
or
Rotherham
then you can speak to one of the Mr Rubble experts who can help to ensure you choose the best skip for the amount of waste you have. In other areas, contact your local skip company and they will be more than happy to assist you. If you are really torn between two sizes, always upsize!
Why Bother?
By using these tips, you can ensure you get the most out of your hired skip. This means you can not only save money that could’ve been spent on an extra skip but you can also make sure you get the clear-out done and dusted quickly and easily.
Benefits of Renting a Skip
You may not be sure if hiring a skip is right for your project or clearout, below are some of the benefits. Skips are a fantastic and affordable way to make home clearouts, renovations and redesigns easier.

Local Skip Hire is Easier Than You Think,16th Apr 2020,https://www.mrrubble.co.uk/local-skip-hire-is-easier-than-you-think/,"Local Skip Hire is Easier Than You Think
Hiring a skip these days is so quick and easy, we suspect you could book it all right now from your computer or phone. It’s nowhere near as intimidating as you might think, trust me! To avoid any unnecessary stress, here’s a quick guide to hiring a skip.
Find Your Local Skip Hire Company
Thanks to the internet finding a local skip company can be as simple as typing ‘Skip hire near me’ or ‘skips near me’ into a search engine and within seconds you’ll have a list of companies in the area. You could also check the website of the local council as they often list businesses in the area. Of course, to ensure a positive experience we recommend you ensure the skip company has a valid waste carrier license number and also take a look at customer reviews to avoid company’s others have had bad experiences with.
Hire Online or Via the Phone
Once you’ve found a good local skip hire company, you can book your skip hire usually either online or on the phone.  The process is quick and easy, if you are unsure of exactly what you need it may be better to phone the company and speak with someone directly as they will be able to help you decide what size skip is necessary for your needs. At Mr Rubble booking
skip hire in Sheffield
is a simple 3 step process to booking your skip online:
Step 1:
Skip requirements. This is where you would provide information on: the size skip you need, the date you would like it delivered, where you would like the skip to be placed, the kind of waste you will be throwing away (garden, building or mixed) and any special instructions.
Step 2:
Delivery & Billing Address.
Step 3:
Confirmation!  It’s that easy!!
The Skip Gets Delivered
Now is the day of your skip delivery. The skip hire company will deliver the skip to your address and place it as per your instructions. You’ve already organized, paid for and had the skip delivered – all at the click of a button! Now all you need to do is fill the skip.
Fill the Skip
One of the most asked questions is, “What can I put in the skip?”. The waste you can put in a skip varies greatly; garden waste, building waste and mixed waste tend to be the main groups. It is easier to answer the question, “What CAN’T I put in the skip?” as the list is way shorter. Current legislations state you cannot put the following items into a skip:
Batteries
Fridges
Fridge freezers
Electrical appliances
T.V. monitors
Air conditioning units
Paints
Fluorescent light tubes
Fire extinguishers
Gas Bottles
Solvents, aerosols, liquids, oil, fuel & other automotive fluids
Tyres
Plasterboard
Medical Waste
Toxic Materials
Call or arrange for pick up
Once your skip is full you can arrange for it to be picked up. If you hadn’t agreed upon a collection date at the beginning, once the skip is full you can contact the skip hire company and arrange for it to be collected. If you require another skip you can easily organize this at the same time. The skip hire company will collect the full skip and responsibly dispose of the contents (Mr Rubble recycles 93% of all waste that comes to us!).
That’s it! Easy as pie.

How Skip Waste Is Recycled,17th Apr 2020,https://www.mrrubble.co.uk/how-skip-waste-is-recycled/,"How Skip Waste Is Recycled
Here at Mr Rubble Skip Hire recycling is one of our top priorities, in fact, we recycle 98% of the waste we collect. This means that when we take a full skip away, we don’t just tip the rubbish into a hole and forget about it; we actually separate and sort the waste in order to reuse as much as possible. The less that goes to landfill the better it is for all of us, fortunately our recycling centre helps to make the recycling process that much easier, but you may be wondering what actually happens to the 93% of recycled waste. Below we’ve outlined the main materials that will be separated and recycled:
Paper Materials
Any paper and card in our skips will be washed and pulped in order to ready it for being used again. The pulp will be used to make more products such as newspapers. It sounds simple and unimportant until you consider that 73% less air pollution is produced when making products with recycled paper compared to making new paper from raw materials.
Glass
Glass can be recycled time and time again. Once separated from other materials, the glass is often melted down so it can be remoulded and reused. The creation of new glass from old glass means it will always have a purpose when it is recycled. It is important that we stop glass from going to landfill as it would remain there for a very long time without breaking down.
Biodegradable Materials
If you require
Sheffield skip hire
or
Rotherham skip hire
and are planning to throw out garden waste, rest assured knowing we will recycle any biodegradable materials and it will be shredded and turned into compost.
Metals
Any aluminium cans found in our skips will be recycled where they will go through a shredding and melting process before being turned into new cans, a process that uses only 5% of the energy that would be needed to create a new can from raw materials. Any ferrous and non-ferrous metals will be melted down at a treatment plant in order to be used to make new items.
Plastics
It is not unusual to have plastic products in the skip waste we receive. Plastic doesn’t biodegrade and if it goes to landfill it will stay there so we want to do our best to ensure all plastic items go for recycling. The plastic can then be reprocessed and made into new plastic items such as bottles.
Aggregates & Soil
Any brick, rubble and soil that comes to us is recycled. The rubble is crushed and reused for building material and construction projects. The recycled soil goes to civil gardeners and landscapers.
Wood
Wood is recycled and used to make new chipboard and fibreboard (MDF).
Cable
Cable is stripped for copper before being disposed of.

5 interesting facts about skip hire,2nd Apr 2020,https://www.mrrubble.co.uk/5-interesting-facts-about-skip-hire/,"5 interesting facts about skip hire
These days we all know what a
‘skip’
is – a large open-topped waster container designed to be removed by lorry as opposed to being emptied into a bin lorry – but did you know where the word
‘skip’
comes from? Read on to find out along with 4 other facts about skips you didn’t know you didn’t know.
Where did the word skip come from?
The word ‘skip’ originally came from the old Norse (or Scandinavian) word ‘skeppa’ meaning ‘basket’. The North Germanic peoples of the Early Middle Ages began an emigration in the 8th century bringing with them their language and culture. The word ‘Skeppa’ was absorbed into old English as the word ‘skep’ which eventually became the word ‘skip’ as we’re familiar with today.
Why are skips the colour they are?
When skips started to become commercially available and popular, the UK Highways Act imposed regulations on skips. These regulations said that skips should be visible in the dark and the colour that was regarded as the most easily visible in low light was yellow. However, these days, many skip companies choose to use colours that more closely match their business colours and their skips are made more visible using lights and cones.
What are the restrictions on placing a skip?
Skips placed on a public highway must be licenced or permit and have the required safety lights and markings. Otherwise the skip company could face a fine up-to £1000. Also, to obtain this permit, you must be an authorised Skip Hire Contractor. The licence is obtained from the Local Highway Authority as required under section 139 of the Highways Act 1980 and last for a maximum of 15 days. These regulations apply to Sheffield skips & Rotherham skips so variations may apply around the other local authorities in the UK. Skips placed on private land don’t have the same restrictions.
Why do skips exist?
Basically, convenience but also cost! Isn’t it much easier for people to simply fill up a large container and have someone take it away for them? It’s also often much more economical to allow a company that specialises in waste recycling, such as Mr Rubble in Sheffield & Rotherham, to deal with your waste as they have the scale and facilities to deal with it effectively and on a large scale.
When were the first skips introduced in the UK?
Prior to 1960, some companies used carts or wagons that had an almost identical function as skips. The introduction of builders skips as we know them today in the 1960s coincided with the widespread availability of portable machinery that was able to lift and shift the weight.

Answers to common skip hire questions
When hiring a skip there are many questions you want answered. Here at Mr Rubble, we are happy to answer all questions for our
Sheffield skip hire
&
Rotherham skip hire
customers. From wondering what size skip you need, to how your waste will impact the environment, we are very happy to respond to all your queries.
One of the most commonly asked questions by our customers is
what size skip they need,
and
what areas we cover
. We are proud to be a prominent company in both Sheffield and Rotherham and all the surrounding areas. Our team at Mr Rubble are happy to supply individuals, contractors and commercial companies three different sizes of skip – 3 tonne, 5 tonne and 8 tonne skips. If you’re not sure what size would be most suitable, feel free to contact us and we can advise you on which skip to hire.
Once you have decided what size skip you need, it is important to know where you are going to place it. Skips can be kept in gardens, driveways and on pavements and roads. If you require your skip to be placed on a pavement, it is important to get a permit off the council. Don’t worry, we can sort this for you as part of your Sheffield or Rotherham skip hire price. If a permit isn’t granted, we also offer a ‘wait and load’ service, popular with builders who gather waste quickly. Don’t hesitate to contact us and ask more.
Along with our dedication to getting our customers the right skip for them, here at Mr Rubble we understand how important it is we reduce the effects skip waste has on the environment. When collecting skips (usually between 3 – 7 days after delivery), we try to arrange collections around deliveries to help our company become eco-friendly. All waste in our skips is taken to our own recycling facility and disposed of in an environmentally friendly way. Due to this, it is important to note that there are items customers are restricted to put in a skip. These items include products such as batteries, fridges, gas bottles and aerosols to name a few. You will find a full list of restricted items on our website. If these are found in a skip, we will return it to you, and you could be fined.

How Mr Rubble Looks After the Environment
When you choose Mr Rubble
Sheffield skip hire
and
Rotherham skip hire,
you are choosing to help the environment. Here at Mr Rubble we are passionate about looking after the environment, both close to home and further afield. With our own purpose-built recycling centre first established in 2006, we recycle 98% of all waste we collect – a percentage that is rising. Recycling our waste is important to us as a company, ensuring we don’t contribute to the worlds rising waste problem. Landfills in the UK are filling up, creating toxic chemicals and gasses that are harmful to both animals and the nature that surrounds us. The whole team at Mr Rubble are proud to belong to an eco-friendly company. From arranging deliveries and collections in an environmentally sound way using fewer fossil fuels, to recycling every bit of waste that we can.
The majority of waste we collect can be recycled and we are continually striving to recycle more. As we know it is important that the waste we recycle is used again so we recycle over 98% of the waste we collect in our skips. For example, our wood waste is used to make chipboards and mdf, while our plastic recyclables are repossessed. Metals are sent to continue Sheffield’s Steel City tradition and are used to make steel. Glass is melted down and used to create new glass, meaning it will always have a purpose when recycled. Waste such as glass is important to be recycled and not put on landfill as it is a material that will take a very long time to naturally decompose.
Not only does recycling affect the whole world, but also our own little slice of it. The soils and green waste collected by us at Mr Rubble are sent to civil gardeners and landscapers, while waste aggregates are used in the building of new roads. The waste we produce can be used to create something beautiful, showing just how beneficial it is to recycle. Here at Mr Rubble we are proud of the recycling that we do, but we are always striving to do more.
If you have any queries about the recycling we do or the products you can put in a skip to be recycled,

Confused about recycling? You’re not alone!,2nd Apr 2020,https://www.mrrubble.co.uk/confused-about-recycling-youre-not-alone/,"Confused about recycling? You’re not alone!
Recycling is confusing. In recent years, disposing of waste and the impact it has on the environment has been the centre of news reports and filled frequent headlines. More and more people are recycling across the country, but a lot of people still aren’t sure how to properly do it. Here at Mr Rubble, we are passionate about sustainability. 93% of the waste we collect from both our
Sheffield skip hire
and
Rotherham skip hire
customers is sent to our purpose-built recycling centre, established in 2006. We care about the environment, and one of the best ways to look out for it is to ensure all our customers understand what and when to recycle.
Most people have an understanding of the common materials to recycle, items such as glass, cardboard and plastic, but what about things like greaseproof paper? A recent study by the cleaning brand Ecover uncovered that 60% of people in the UK say they frequently recycle, but 37% say they are unsure on what can be reprocessed, so send green items to landfill. One of the most common materials people get confused about is plastic. It is always a good idea to look for the green recycling stamp on any plastic packaging, which should tell you if something can be sent to be reprocessed. However, as these are sometimes unclear and differ from brand to brand, your best bet is to Google the item; the quickest way to find out where it should be put.
Local councils across the UK have different recycling standards on what items are accepted. Always check with your council what days each bin is collected and have a look at their recycling policy to ensure you are recycling the correct things and maximising the amount you do. Despite councils having differing policies, there are a lot of common items people think can’t be put in the green bin, but they can be.
Items that CAN be recycled:
Kitchen foil and foil food tins.
Deodorant aerosols and hairspray cans with plastic lids.
Metal lids.
Bleach bottles.
Aluminium tubes such as tomato puree.
Along with this, it is equally as important to only put items that can be recycled into the green bin. Materials that are yet unable to be reprocessed will slow down recycling systems and will have to be transported to landfill, burning more fossil fuels than necessary.
Items that CAN’T be recycled:
Kitchen roll.
Straws.
Greasy take-away boxes.
Laminated foil / soft plastic such as pet food pouches.
Nail varnish bottles.
Cutlery.
Shampoo bottles that haven’t been rinsed.

Top tips for home recycling,2nd Apr 2020,https://www.mrrubble.co.uk/top-tips-for-home-recycling/,"Top tips for home recycling
The average household in the UK produces more than a tonne of waste every year. Recycling at home is very important; the little things can have huge impacts. Learning what can be recycled and how to do it may seem like a daunting task, but at Mr Rubble
Sheffield skip hire
, we are all about making it easy for you. With a few simple steps, recycling at home can transform from a chore into something fun for all the family. Not only can recycling reduce your own household waste, but it will also greatly benefit the environment and the world around you. Remember however, if you have a large quantity of waste,
hiring a skip
may save you time, money and effort. Mr Rubble can help, with three https://www.mrrubble.co.uk/skip-hire-sheffield/different sizes of skips available for our Sheffield and
Rotherham skip hire
customers, we will have something to suit you.
What can you recycle?
Plastic bottles
– A lot of household plastic is produced from ‘soft’ plastic, a material that can be easily reprocessed. Items such as sauce bottles, mouthwash and milk containers can all be put in the green bin. Check with your recycling centre, but sometimes stronger plastic such as Tuppaware can also be recycled.
Junk mail / Scrap paper
– The trick with junk mail is to process it as soon as it arrives. Instead of letting it pile up and clutter, take it straight to recycling.
Cardboard
– Items such as cereal boxes and biscuit packets are easily reused, just ensure to open them up and break them down before putting them in the bin. Not only will this save you space in your recycling container, but also make the process of recycling cardboard that bit more efficient.
Metallic items
– Waste such as spray cans, food containers and tin foil can all be recycled.
Glass bottles
– Glass products such as bottles can always be reprocessed and used again, the making of which uses much less energy than glass being produced from raw materials.
Check with your council what items can be recycled
It’s always useful to check with your council what items can be recycled and where to put them, as guidelines differ from region to region.
Setting up a system to remind your household to recycle is a quick way to ensure no green items are being thrown in the black bin. An effective idea is to put a recycling poster in a place where all the family will see it, perhaps in the kitchen or on the back of a door? Placing a recycling container next to your indoor bin, one that is always in clear view, is also a simple way to create a constant reminder to recycle and reduce the amount of waste your household is producing.

At Mr Rubble Skip Hire we are passionate about doing our best, not only for our customers but also for our community and the Earth. We do this by making recycling a top priority, in fact if you
hire a skip
with us you don’t need to spend time separating the waste or worrying about where the rubbish will end up. Back in 2006, our state-of-the-art recycling centre opened allowing us to efficiently ensure we recycle as much of the waste as possible.
Our team care about the environment and are committed to doing what we can to keep the world clean. We pride ourselves on the quality of the service we provide and ensure this continues even after we’ve taken the full skip away, so rest assured knowing that all of the waste is dealt with in a legal and environmentally friendly way.
We recycle to help:
Lessen pollution
– recycling and reusing materials is a great way to reduce pollution by avoiding new products being unnecessarily created.
Avoid landfills
– By recycling we can reduce the amount of waste that is going into landfill. Landfill is very damaging to the environment and wildlife so if the waste doesn’t have to go to landfill we make sure it won’t.
Reduce costs
– When you consider recycling from a financial standpoint, it costs considerably less to repurpose materials than to create products from new materials. Large scale recycling = big savings for businesses. If landfills continue to increase in size then communities will be taxed more in order to cover the fines and landfill taxes associated with exceeding landfill allowances. I’m sure you’d agree this is something we’d all like to avoid so choose a responsible skip hire company to help meet your skip needs. A responsible skip hire company does not mean an expensive skip hire company – take a look at
www.mrrubble.co.uk

Why are we so passionate about recycling the waste we receive?
With waste, and the way it is being disposed of, causing problems around the globe we are committed to leading by example at Mr Rubble. Reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfill is a priority, DEFRA reported that, in 2016, 45.2% of household waste was recycled and outlined the 2020 target as 50% or more.

Moving House in Sheffield: Tips for an Efficient Clearout,28th Sep 2020,https://www.mrrubble.co.uk/moving-house-in-sheffield-tips-for-an-efficient-clearout/,"Moving House in Sheffield: Tips for an Efficient Clearout
Moving house can be a stressful time but preparing in advance can help to save a lot of hassle. One way you can do this is to start by clearing your house ready for the move.
Read our tips below on how you can efficiently clear out items to stand you in good stead for moving house.
Preparation is key
Clearing and sorting your things can take a long time, as you’ve accumulated so many belongings over the years. Being prepared and starting this in advance can really help. Make sure you are stocked up on bin bags, storage boxes and cardboard boxes.
Work room by room and sort into different piles: things to keep, things to sell, things for charity, and things to bin.
Don’t get distracted
With any clearance, it’s so easy to get distracted by items you rediscover, such as old photographs or mementos. Stick to the task at hand and put sentimental items to one side so that you can take the time to look at them later. Aim to sort as much as you can. Everything you manage to sort is less work for another day!
Don’t be afraid to be ruthless
When we accumulate belongings, we become attached to them. This can make it difficult when it comes time to have a clearout. When space is limited and you have a lot to sort through, it’s good to have a refresh. Don’t be afraid to be ruthless when getting rid of items. Ask yourself the following questions:
-Is it important to keep this?
-When did I last use this item?
-Can I live without it?
-Do I need a replacement item as this is a little worn?
Keep important documents in a folder
Ensure that important documents are organised in a folder so that you know where everything is. This will help to avoid accidentally throwing anything important away.
Ask for help
Call in some favours and ask round friends and family to see if anyone can help you to sort your things. It can be a daunting task to clear a full house so get as much help as you can.
Hire a skip
Hire a skip for any items you do decide to get rid of. At Mr Rubble, we have a
range of skip sizes
depending on the scale of your house clearance. It couldn’t be simpler – each of our skips has information on how much rubbish it can hold and what it would be suitable for. Simply fill in our contact form to book a skip and we’ll deliver it on your required date.
